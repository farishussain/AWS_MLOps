# SageMaker MLOps Pipeline Project

A complete end-to-end machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline using Amazon SageMaker, designed for local development and AWS deployment.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full MLOps lifecycle:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment and serving
- Monitoring and governance

## Quick Start
1. Review `PLANNING.md` for project scope and architecture
2. Follow tasks in `TASK.md` starting with Phase 1
3. Set up your AWS credentials and development environment
4. Begin with the priority tasks listed in TASK.md

## Structure
- `PLANNING.md` - High-level project planning and architecture
- `TASK.md` - Detailed implementation tasks and timeline
- Additional directories will be created as the project progresses

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account with SageMaker access
- Python 3.8+
- AWS CLI configured
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts

## Getting Started
Start with Task 1.1 in `TASK.md` to set up your development environment.
